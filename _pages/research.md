    title: "Cooperative Missions with Heterogeneous Networked Teams"
    excerpt: "We consider the problem of mission planning in teams of cooperative autonomous agents. The teams that we consider feature physical agents (e.g., robots, humans, animals) and are heterogeneous.  The general goal of this research work is to define
a formal model and solution methods for tackling the problem of mission
planning in cooperative, heterogeneous, networked multi-agent/robot systems in
scenarios with spatially-distributed tasks. The aim is to achieve the general
goal by defining models and solutions that show good scalability and
versatility, and that account for the complexity of real-world applications"
