I am a postdoctoral associate at the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
Mellon University in Qatar. I completed my PhD in Informatics at the Dalle Molle
Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA) in Lugano in 2017.

My research interests are mobile robotics, multi-robot coordination,
reinforcement learning, and mobile wireless networks. Currently, I am applying
machine learning techniques to multi-robot coordination. At IDSIA , I was part
of the [robotics lab](https://idsia-robotics.github.io/) and I worked on
several multidisciplinary projects, including the [SWARMIX project](https://youtu.be/WWUpqY3RoUw) and [NCCR Robotics](http://www.nccr-robotics.ch) under
the supervision of Professor Luca M. Gambardella.
