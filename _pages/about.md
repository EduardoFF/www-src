    title: "Cooperative Missions with Heterogeneous Networked Team"
    excerpt: "We consider the problem of mission planning in teams of cooperative autonomous agents. The teams that we consider feature physical agents (e.g., robots, humans, animals) and are heterogeneous.  The general goal of this research work is to define
a formal model and solution methods for tackling the problem of mission
planning in cooperative, heterogeneous, networked multi-agent/robot systems in
scenarios with spatially-distributed tasks. The aim is to achieve the general
goal by defining models and solutions that show good scalability and
versatility, and that account for the complexity of real-world applications"

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
Mellon University in Qatar. I completed my PhD in Informatics at the [Dalle Molle
Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA)](http://www.idsia.ch) in Lugano in 2017.

My research interests are mobile robotics, multi-robot coordination,
reinforcement learning, and mobile wireless networks. Currently, I am applying
machine learning techniques to multi-robot coordination. At CMU-Q, I am
assisting several CS courses and contributing to the outreach programs. At IDSIA
, I was part of the [robotics lab](https://idsia-robotics.github.io/) and I
worked on several multidisciplinary projects, including the [SWARMIX
project](https://youtu.be/WWUpqY3RoUw) and [NCCR
Robotics](http://www.nccr-robotics.ch) under the supervision of Professor Luca
M. Gambardella.
